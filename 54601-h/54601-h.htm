<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TO one opening this book for the first time, it may
be permissible to say that the verse included
in the volume does not treat solely nor chiefly of
Canadian themes. While Canadian environment and
life necessarily supply the note of inspiration and
impart its timbre and accent, the thought and
emotion are of wide range, and seek response in the
universal heart.</p>

<p>The practical energies of the Canadian people are
abundantly attested by extensive systems of railways
and canals, a wide commerce, systems of free public
education in the several provinces and territories,
liberal facilities for the higher education of men and
women, and an enterprising and influential press.
Thirty-two years have passed since the organization
of the Dominion of Canada. These years have
witnessed great progress in civil and social institutions,
and no unworthy beginning of an adequate
development of the illimitable material resources of
Canada's vast domain. It is noteworthy, as marking
the quality of life of the people, that from the earliest
settlement of the several provinces there have not
been wanting public evidences of the presence of the
scientific and literary spirit. The latter has expressed
itself both in prose and verse, and in these recent
years there is an increased activity in literary production
commensurate with the expanding life of
Canada.</p>

<p>It has been my purpose to present worthy specimens
of English-Canadian verse, selected from the entire
field of our history. Such a collection should be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
interest, not only to Canadians, but to all English-speaking
peoples. Here are reflected the singular
loveliness of our evanescent spring, the glow and
luxuriant life of our hasting summer, the sensuous
glory of our autumn, and the tingle of our frosty air
and the white winter's cheer. Every form and aspect
of natural beauty is, in some degree, caught and expressed&mdash;sometimes
in homely, sometimes in classical
phrase; often with striking simplicity, and generally
with much purity of thought and an authentic note. A
sane and wholesome spirit is characteristic of the verse,
and its spiritual quality seems to me to be of a high
order. The sympathetic reader will notice a marked
pictorial use of nature in some of the specimens given,
as well as a sensuous delight in nature itself, depicted,
as it is, with true feeling and not infrequently with
an almost flawless art. He will notice also that
nature is often humanized, and tenderness, love and
pity, and the subtle problems of man's life and
existence, are enshrined in original and poetic
similitudes to the melody of haunting music. Nor
are there altogether wanting instances of that insight
and vision which beholds the phenomenal and cosmic
with rapt wonder as awesome beauty-gleams, radiant
symbols, or sublime manifestations of the immanent
and loving One in whom all things consist. Great
personalities, high achievement, and noble character,
also, have inspired Canadian song. From the earliest
to the latest singer, a glowing devotion to native land
and a loyal and loving reverence for our gracious
Sovereign are characteristic notes. If it should appear
that the abundant verse inspired by these latter
motives is insufficiently represented in this anthology,
it may suffice to say that such verse is already widely
known and is not by any means the highest product
of the Canadian muse. Room has been made for
the less hackneyed and richer inspirations of our
poets&mdash;the virgin freshness and promise of our
country; the life and deeds of men everywhere; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
yearnings of the individual soul; and the aspirations
of a people after the noblest and the divinest. These,
with domestic loves, have kindled our singers to
beautiful expression that demands a wider appreciation,
as supplying sustenance and stimulus essential
to fulness of national and imperial life. It will be
observed that not only in recent verse, but also in
that of nearly fifty years ago, Canadian poets have
given expression to Anglo-centric conceptions and
aspirations, divining with poetic insight the coming
good.</p>

<p>While the selections have been carefully made, it
will be apparent that some verse has been included
whose chief claim to recognition is found in local and
popular associations. It should also be said that
much popular verse has been excluded, in order that
the volume be kept of usable form and size. It did
not fall within the plan of this anthology to include
sacred and devotional lyrics, otherwise not a few
hymns must have found a place, notably Joseph
Scriven's "What a Friend we have in Jesus," known
as widely as the language is spoken.</p>

<p>The printing together of the selections from any
author has been advisedly adopted, as affording a
greater variety and interest than could be secured by
an abstract or logical classification of the verse of the
entire volume. The convenience of an alphabetical
order of authors is apparent, while the dates supplied
in the <i>Notes</i> afford ample chronology. Here and
there the reader may find unfilled dates of birth or
death, or unexpanded initials of names, but all reasonable
effort has been made to furnish complete and
trustworthy information.</p>

<p>I wish to express my gratitude to Mr. Charles C.
James, M.A., Deputy Minister of Agriculture for
Ontario, who has given me free access to his valuable
and extensive collection of the works of Canadian
poets; to Mr. James Bain, Jr., of the Toronto Public
Library, for special facilities for inspecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
excellent collection in his charge; and to Mr. E. S.
Caswell, of the publishing house of William Briggs,
for many courtesies, and specially for aid in procuring
well-nigh inaccessible materials for examination. To
the many persons who have so cordially responded
to letters of inquiry, and whom I may not thank by
name, I express my acknowledgments. The following
special works have been of service: <i>Selections from
Canadian Poets</i>(1864), by Edward Hartley Dewart;
<i>The Canadian Birthday Book</i>(1887), by Seranus;
<i>Songs of the Great Dominion</i>(1889), by William
Douw Lighthall, M.A., and Morgan's <i>Canadian Men
and Women of the Time</i>.</p>

<p>Special thanks are rendered to the authors who
have permitted the use of their poems, and to the
various publishers for copyright permission. I regret
that I was unable to secure permission to include any
poems by Mr. William Wilfred Campbell. Perhaps
the selections from my own verse should not appear
in the volume. Their inclusion, it is proper to say, is
in deference to the wishes of persons of acknowledged
taste, rather than to any desire of my own.</p>

<p>A Canadian by birth, education, and life-service,
as were my father and his father, my mother and her
mother, I may be pardoned the expression of a feeling
of national pride that the materials are so abundant
from which to prepare a representative volume, much
of whose contents will not suffer by comparison with
the verse of older countries. I trust that this anthology
may serve as an open door through which the voices
of Canadian singers may vibrate yet more widely on
sympathetic ears both at home and abroad.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">O BLESSED angel of the All-bounteous King,</p>
<p class="i5">Where dost thou stay so long? our sad hearts pine,</p>
<p class="i0">Our spirits faint for thee. Our weary eyes</p>
<p class="i0">Scan all the blue expanse, where not a cloud</p>
<p class="i0">Floats low to rest our vision. In vain we turn</p>
<p class="i0">Or east or west, no vaporous haze, nor view</p>
<p class="i0">Of distant panorama, wins our souls</p>
<p class="i0">To other worlds. All, all is hard and scant.</p>
<p class="i14">Thy brother Spring is come.</p>
<p class="i0">His favourite haunts the sheltering woods betray&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">The woods that, dark and cheerless yet, call thee.</p>
<p class="i0">Tender hepaticas peep forth, and mottled leaves</p>
<p class="i0">Of yellow dog's tooth vie with curly fronds</p>
<p class="i0">Of feathery ferns, in strewing o'er his path;</p>
<p class="i0">The dielytra puts her necklace on,</p>
<p class="i0">Of pearly pendants, topaz-tipped or rose.</p>
<p class="i0">Gray buds are on the orchard trees, and grass</p>
<p class="i0">Grows up in single blades and braves the sun.</p>
<p class="i0">But thou!&mdash;O, where art thou, sweet early Rain,</p>
<p class="i0">That with thy free libations fill'st our cup?</p>
<p class="i0">The contemplative blue-bird pipes his note</p>
<p class="i0">From off the ridge-cap, but can find no spot</p>
<p class="i0">Fit for his nest. The red-breast on the fence</p>
<p class="i0">Explores the pasture with his piercing eye,</p>
<p class="i0">And visits oft the bushes by the stream,</p>
<p class="i0">But takes no mate. For why? No leaves or tufts</p>
<p class="i0">Are there to hide a house....</p>
<p class="i14">A-missing thee</p>
<p class="i0">The husbandman goes forth with faltering step</p>
<p class="i0">And dull sad eye; his sweltering team pulls hard</p>
<p class="i0">The labouring plough, but the dry earth falls back</p>
<p class="i0">As dead, and gives nor fragrant fume, nor clogs</p>
<p class="i0">The plough-boy's feet with rich encumbering mould.</p>
<p class="i0">The willows have a little tender green,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>

<p class="i0">Now fallen to pools&mdash;but, disappointed,</p>
<p class="i0">Dash away so swift, and fly so high</p>
<p class="i0">We scarce can follow them. Thus all the land</p>
<p class="i0">Doth mourn for thee.&mdash;</p>
<p class="i14">Ah! here thou comest, sweet Rain.</p>
<p class="i0">Soft, tender Rain! benison of the skies!</p>
<p class="i0">See now, what transformation in thy touch!</p>
<p class="i0">Straight all the land is green. The blossoming trees</p>
<p class="i0">Put on their bridal wreaths, and veil their charms</p>
<p class="i0">From the too ardent sun, beneath thy gift</p>
<p class="i0">Of soft diaphanous tissue, pure and white</p>
<p class="i0">As angels' raiment. Little wood children</p>
<p class="i0">Deck all the path with flowers. The teeming earth</p>
<p class="i0">Offers rich gifts. The little choristers</p>
<p class="i0">Sing ceaseless hymns, and the glad husbandman</p>
<p class="i0">Adds his diapason. Bright fountains wake</p>
<p class="i0">And mingle with the swift roulade of streams.</p>
<p class="i0">The earth is full of music! Thou dost swing</p>
<p class="i0">Thy fragrant censer high, and dwellers in</p>
<p class="i0">The dusty city raise their toil-worn heads</p>
<p class="i0">From desk and bench, and cry "Summer is here!"</p>
<p class="i0">And straight they smell new hay and clover blooms,</p>
<p class="i0">And see the trout swift-darting in the brooks,</p>
<p class="i0">And the plover whistling in the fields.</p>
<p class="i0">The little children dream of daisy chains,</p>
<p class="i0">And pent-up youth thinks of a holiday,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">A holiday with romps, and cream, and flowers.</p>
<p class="i0">O, Rain! O, soft, sweet Rain! O liberal Rain!</p>
<p class="i0">Touch our hard hearts, that we may more become</p>
<p class="i0">Like that Great Heart whose almoner art thou.</p>

<p class="i0">The leaves that had silently flung</p>

<p class="i2">So soft we scarcely notice how they wend,</p>
<p class="i0">And like a smile half happy, or a sigh,</p>
<p class="i2">The summer passes to her quiet end;</p>
<p class="i0">And soon, too soon, around the cumbered eaves</p>
<p class="i2">Shy frosts shall take the creepers by surprise,</p>
<p class="i2">And through the wind-touched reddening woods shall rise</p>
<p class="i0">October with the rain of ruined leaves.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN sooth he was a mighty King,</p>
<p class="i3">And ruled in splendid state,</p>
<p class="i0">Surrounded by a haughty band</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">For though a king be good and great</p>
<p class="i2">And generous, I trow</p>
<p class="i0">His nobles yet will envy him,</p>

<p class="i0">For so hath been the ancient strife</p>
<p class="i0">Since man first took his sovereign's life.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And thus, to gain their foul design,</p>
<p class="i2">They planned to lie in wait,</p>
<p class="i0">And drop a deadly poison in</p>
<p class="i2">The golden flagon great,</p>
<p class="i0">That never more the King should rule;</p>
<p class="i0">And no one heard them but the fool.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">So when the King came down that night</p>
<p class="i2">Into his hall to dine,</p>
<p class="i0">He found his flagon in its place,</p>
<p class="i2">And at its side the wine&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">The blood-red wine&mdash;at which he said,</p>
<p class="i0">"Such wine should put life in the dead!"</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then poured he full the poisoned cup,</p>
<p class="i2">And, raising it on high,</p>
<p class="i0">O'er all his courtiers in the hall</p>
<p class="i2">He ran his noble eye:</p>
<p class="i0">"Oh, I would drink," he said, with zest,</p>
<p class="i0">"Unto the man that loves me best!"</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then mute they sat around the board,</p>
<p class="i2">And each looked to the other,</p>
<p class="i0">Till rose, with mocking reverence,</p>
<p class="i2">The fool, and said, "Good brother,</p>
<p class="i0">All round this board, of every guest,</p>
<p class="i0">I am the man that loves thee best."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then wrothful was the King, and said,</p>

<p class="i0">That makest such a silly jest</p>
<p class="i2">At such a time as this.</p>
<p class="i0">Give us a better jest," he said,</p>
<p class="i0">"Or pay the forfeit with thy head."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then quoth the fool, "My good liege lord,</p>

<p class="i2">That I will take my rest,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<p class="i0">No more to be thy jester," and</p>
<p class="i0">He snatched the flagon from his hand.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then dark became the King's great brow,</p>
<p class="i2">Amazed was every guest,</p>
<p class="i0">While with the flagon at his lips</p>
<p class="i2">The fool quoth, "This sweet jest</p>
<p class="i0">That man, I trow, will best divine</p>
<p class="i0">Who poured such strength into this wine"&mdash;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then drained the goblet at a draught,</p>
<p class="i2">And set it down anon,</p>
<p class="i0">While round the board each face grew pale,</p>
<p class="i2">And strange to look upon;</p>
<p class="i0">Then sank the fool into his place,</p>
<p class="i0">And on the table laid his face.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Amid the silence stood the King,</p>
<p class="i2">As if perplexed with doubt;</p>
<p class="i0">He looked upon his poor dead fool,</p>
<p class="i2">And then looked round about;</p>
<p class="i0">And then in thunder called the guard</p>
<p class="i0">That near him kept their watch and ward.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">He bid them take the traitors forth</p>
<p class="i2">And put them all to death.</p>
<p class="i0">"Would God," he cried, "their lives could give</p>
<p class="i2">My poor fool back his breath&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">My poor dead fool, whose silent breast</p>
<p class="i0">Doth show, too late, he loved me best!"</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">This is the legend of a fool</p>
<p class="i2">Who died his king to save,</p>
<p class="i0">And to its truth a monument</p>
<p class="i2">Was built above his grave;</p>
<p class="i0">And on it in gold this wording ran,</p>
<p class="i0">"He lived a fool, but died a man."</p>

<p class="i4">Hung o'er the battlements of Slaines,&mdash;a fortress grim and tall.</p>

<p class="i0">No gleam of torch or taper pierced the shadows of the night;</p>
<p class="i0">Only the rippling of the Dee blent faintly with the sound</p>

<p class="i0">The Warder hummed a careless song his lonely watch to cheer;</p>
<p class="i0">Knight, squire, and page, on rush-strewn floors, were stretched in sound repose,</p>
<p class="i0">While spear and falchions, dim with dust, hung round in idle rows;</p>
<p class="i0">And none of all those vassals bold, who calmly dreaming lay,</p>
<p class="i0">Dreamed that a foe was lurking near, impatient for the fray.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="i0">In the dim valley of the Dee, a bow-shot from the keep,</p>
<p class="i0">A ghost-like multitude defiled in silence from the wood</p>
<p class="i0">That with its stately pines concealed the Fort for many a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">rood,&mdash;</span></p>
<p class="i0">The banner of that spectral host is soiled with murderous <span style="white-space: nowrap;">stains&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="i0">For Pity is an angel-guest their hearts have never known.</p>
<p class="i0">And now the caitiffs steal by night to storm the Fort of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Slaines&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="i0">And all who hunger for the spoil with spoil shall be regaled.</p>

<p class="i0">Each clansman started from his couch and armed him for the fight;</p>

<p class="i0">Upon the Tigers of the Sea, the carnage-loving Danes.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The lurid glare of torches served to light them to their foes:</p>
<p class="i0">They hewed those felons, hip and thigh, with stern, relentless blows;</p>
<p class="i0">Claymore and battle-axe and spear were steeped in slaughter's flood,</p>
<p class="i0">While every thistle in the moat was splashed with crimson blood;</p>
<p class="i0">And when the light of morning broke, the legions of the Danes</p>
<p class="i0">Lay stiff and stark, in ghastly heaps, around the Fort of Slaines!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Nine hundred years have been engulfed within the grave of Time</p>
<p class="i0">Since those grim Vikings of the North by death atoned their crime.</p>
<p class="i0">In memory of that awful night, the thistle's hardy grace</p>
<p class="i0">Was chosen as the emblem meet of Albin's dauntless race;</p>
<p class="i0">And never since, in battle's storm, on land or on the sea,</p>

<p class="i0">That each shadow form was surely robed</p>
<p class="i2">In the selfsame hue of gray;</p>

<p class="i0">But as one by one they drew near to me,</p>

<p class="i0">To bring me whatever I needed most&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Of chastening or of cheer.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And though some of them, truly, were grave and sad,</p>
<p class="i2">And moved with reluctant feet,</p>
<p class="i0">There were others came gladly, with smiling eyes,</p>
<p class="i2">And footsteps by joy made fleet;</p>
<p class="i0">But whatever with gladness or sorrow fraught,</p>
<p class="i2">The message each bore was sweet.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">For even the saddest, and weighted most</p>
<p class="i2">With trial and pain for me,</p>
<p class="i0">Yet breathed in my ear, ere it passed from sight,</p>
<p class="i2">"This cross I have brought to thee</p>

<p class="i0">So, now, as I watch in the dawning dim</p>

<p class="i0">With gems enclasped it, close as a caress,</p>
<p class="i0">And smoothed its folds out o'er her loveliness</p>
<p class="i0">In fondly fashioned outlines. It was made</p>
<p class="i0">Of Persian satin, opaline and white,</p>
<p class="i0">Like moving mists around the moon arrayed,</p>
<p class="i0">Thro' which she shone, a lovelier light in light</p>
<p class="i0">Almost immortal: on a low divan</p>
<p class="i0">A fleecy texture tinted Tyrian,</p>
<p class="i0">Alone reclining, on each pliant knee</p>
<p class="i0">Her white feet poised by turns to sandalled be.</p>
<p class="i0">The sandal buckles were with gems aflame,</p>
<p class="i0">And those fine bands that bound each knee the same.</p>
<p class="i0">On restless anklets tinkled bells of gold,</p>
<p class="i0">A symbol which of princely lineage told.</p>
<p class="i0">Their music summoning a tiring maid</p>
<p class="i0">Who all her glorious midnight hair arrayed:</p>
<p class="i0">A purple black it was, alive and long,</p>
<p class="i0">And seemed, if such could be, like a carved song,</p>
<p class="i0">Some Hebrew pÃ¦an of triumphant power</p>
<p class="i0">Arrested, and remaining her rare dower.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
<p class="i0">Her zone was also wonderful with these,</p>

<p class="i0">Such as Ezekiel sanctified for use.</p>
<p class="i0">And over these, with garnet bangles hung</p>

<p class="i0">A little scarf of white and henna dyes</p>
<p class="i0">Crowned her dark head for dreadful sacrifice.</p>
<p class="i0">Pensive her oriental eyes, and large,</p>
<p class="i0">Looking their last on Judah's hills, the charge</p>
<p class="i0">Of Israel's honor in them, and the praise</p>

<div class="container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="drop-cap">NAKED and shaggy, they herded at eve by the sound of the seas,</p>
<p class="i4">When the sky and the ocean were red as with blood from the battles of God,</p>
<p class="i0">And the wind like a monster sped forth with its feet on the rocks and the trees,</p>
<p class="i2">And the sands of the desert blew over the wastes of the drought-smitten sod.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Here, mad with the torments of hunger, despairing they sank to their rest,</p>
<p class="i2">Some crouching alone in their anguish, some gathered in groups on the beach;</p>
<p class="i0">And with tears almost human the mother looked down at the babe on her breast,</p>
<p class="i2">And her pain was the germ of our love, and her cry was the root of our speech.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then a cloud from the sunset arose, like a cormorant gorged with its prey,</p>
<p class="i2">And extended its wings on the sky till it smothered the stars in its gloom,</p>
<p class="i0">And ever the famine-worn faces were wet with the wind-carried spray,</p>
<p class="i2">And dimly the voice of the deep to their ears was a portent of doom.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>

<p class="i0">And the dawn that rose up on the morrow, apparelled in gold like a priest,</p>
<p class="i2">Through the smoke of the incense of morning, looked down on a vision of death;</p>
<p class="i0">For the vultures were gathered together and circled with joy to their feast</p>
<p class="i2">On hearts that had ceased from their sorrow, and lips that had yielded their breath.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Then the ages went by like a dream, and the shoreline emerged from the deep,</p>
<p class="i2">And the stars as they watched through the years saw a change on the face of the earth;</p>
<p class="i0">For over the blanket of sand that had covered the dead in their sleep</p>
<p class="i2">Great forests grew up with their green, and the sources of rivers had birth.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">But the law, that was victor of old with its heel on the neck of the brute,</p>
<p class="i2">Still tramples our hearts in the darkness, still grinds down our face in the dust;</p>
<p class="i0">We are sown in corruption and anguish&mdash;whose fingers will gather the fruit?</p>
<p class="i2">Our life is but lent for a season&mdash;for whom do we hold it in trust?</p>

<p class="i0">In the vault of the sky overhead, in the gulfs that lie under our feet,</p>
<p class="i2">The wheels of the universe turn, and the laws of the universe blend;</p>
<p class="i0">The pulse of our life is in tune with the rhythm of forces that beat</p>
<p class="i2">In the surf of the furthest star's sea, and are spent and regathered to spend.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Yet we trust in the will of the Being whose fingers have spangled the night</p>
<p class="i2">With the dust of a myriad worlds, and who speaks in the thunders of space;</p>
<p class="i0">Though we see not the start or the finish, though vainly we cry for the light,</p>
<p class="i2">Let us mount in the glory of manhood and meet the God-Man face to face.</p>

<p class="i2">"Behold! a little while and I am dead;</p>

<p class="i0">Then dwelt I in a garden, where the sun</p>

<p class="i2">Far off the great sea slept, and overhead</p>

<div class="container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="drop-cap">THERE'S a beautiful Artist abroad in the world,</p>
<p class="i5">And her pencil is dipped in heaven,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">The gorgeous hues of Italian skies,</p>
<p class="i0">The radiant sunset's richest dyes,</p>
<p class="i0">The light of Aurora's laughing eyes,</p>
<p class="i4">Are each to her pictures given.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">As I walked abroad yestere'en, what time</p>
<p class="i4">The sunset was fairest to see,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
<p class="i0">I saw her wonderful brush had been</p>
<p class="i0">Over a maple tree&mdash;half of it green&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">And the fairest coloring that ever was seen</p>
<p class="i4">She had left on that maple tree.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">There was red of every possible hue,</p>
<p class="i4">There was yellow of every dye,</p>
<p class="i0">From the faintest straw-tint to orange bright,</p>
<p class="i0">Fluttering, waving, flashing in light,</p>
<p class="i0">With the delicate green leaves still in sight,</p>
<p class="i4">Peeping out at the sunset sky.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">She had touched the beech, and the scraggy thing</p>
<p class="i4">In a bright new suit was dressed;</p>
<p class="i0">Very queer, indeed, it looked to me,</p>
<p class="i0">The sober old beech tree thus to see,</p>
<p class="i0">So different from what he used to be,</p>
<p class="i4">Rigged out in a holiday vest.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Red, and russet, and green, and grey&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">He had little indeed of gold&mdash;</p>
<p class="i0">For the beech was never known to be gay,</p>
<p class="i0">Being noted a very grave tree alway,</p>
<p class="i0">Never flaunting out in a fanciful way</p>
<p class="i4">Like other trees, we are told.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">But the beautiful artist had touched him off</p>
<p class="i4">With an extra tint or so;</p>
<p class="i0">And he held his own very well with the rest,</p>
<p class="i0">On which, I am sure, she had done her best,</p>
<p class="i0">Dressing each in the fairest kind of a vest,</p>
<p class="i4">Till the forest was all aglow.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">There were the willow that grew by the brook,</p>
<p class="i4">And the old oak on the hill,</p>
<p class="i0">The graceful elm tree down in the swale,</p>
<p class="i0">The birch, the ash, and the bass-wood pale,</p>
<p class="i0">The orchard trees clustering over the vale,</p>
<p class="i4">And weeds that fringed the rill.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">One she had gilt with a flood of gold,</p>
<p class="i4">And one she had tipped with flame;</p>
<p class="i0">One, she had dashed with every hue</p>
<p class="i0">That the laughing sunset ever knew,</p>
<p class="i0">And one&mdash;she had colored it through and through</p>
<p class="i4">Russet, all sober and tame.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Now this beautiful artist will only stay</p>
<p class="i4">A very few days, and then</p>
<p class="i0">She will finish her gorgeous pictures all,</p>
<p class="i0">And hurry away ere the gusty squall</p>
<p class="i0">Ruins her work, and the sere leaves fall</p>
<p class="i4">Darkly in copse and glen.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
